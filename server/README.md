## Setup

1. Refer to the PocketBase Go documentation to install Go: https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/.
2. Refer to server/bible_data/README.md to import the Bible database into the pocketbase database.

## Development

Once Go is installed, run `go run main.go serve`, which will start the server and initialize the local database if it does not already exist.

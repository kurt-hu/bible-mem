## Development

Refer to the PocketBase Go documentation to install Go: https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/.

Once Go is installed, run `go run main.go server`, which will start the server and initialize the local database if it does not already exist.

TODO: Setup way to populate local db with table structure and sample user accounts.
